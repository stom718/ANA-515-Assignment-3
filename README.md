NOAA’s Storm Events Database. This data lists major weather-related storm events since 1950. For each event, it includes information like the start and end dates, where it happened,associated deaths, injuries, and property damage, and some other characteristics. Each row is a separate event. However, often several events are grouped together within the same episode. Some of the event types are listed by their county ID (FIPS code) (“C”), but some are listed by a forecast zone ID (“Z”). Which ID is used is given in the column CZ_TYPE.
The year that I selected was 1992.
